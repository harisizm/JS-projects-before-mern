  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <h3>For the Burger Patties:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>1.5 lbs ground beef (80/20 blend for best flavor)</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon onion powder</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>For Assembly:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>4 hamburger buns</li>
    <li>4 slices of cheese (cheddar or American)</li>
    <li>1 large tomato, sliced</li>
    <li>1 red onion, sliced</li>
    <li>4 lettuce leaves</li>
    <li>4 pickle slices</li>
    <li>Mayonnaise</li>
    <li>Ketchup</li>
    <li>Mustard</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Remove ground beef from refrigerator 30 minutes before cooking to bring to room temperature.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, gently combine ground beef, salt, pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, and Worcestershire
      sauce.</li>
    <li>Divide the mixture into 4 equal portions and gently form into patties slightly larger than your buns (they'll
      shrink while cooking).</li>
    <li>Create a small indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent puffing.</li>
    <li>Preheat your grill or skillet to medium-high heat. Brush with olive oil.</li>
    <li>Cook patties for 3-4 minutes on the first side without pressing down.</li>
    <li>Flip burgers and cook for another 3-4 minutes for medium doneness.</li>
    <li>If adding cheese, place on patties during the last minute of cooking.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, lightly toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
    <li>Let patties rest for 2-3 minutes after cooking.</li>
    <li>Spread mayo, ketchup, and mustard on the bottom bun.</li>
    <li>Layer with lettuce, tomato, burger patty with cheese, onion, and pickles.</li>
    <li>Top with the other half of the bun and serve immediately.</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Tips for the Perfect Burger</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Don't overmix the meat - this can make burgers tough</li>
    <li>Never press down on burgers while cooking - it squeezes out the juices</li>
    <li>Use a meat thermometer: 160°F for well-done, 155°F for medium</li>
    <li>Let the meat rest after cooking to redistribute juices</li>
    <li>Toast the buns for better texture and to prevent sogginess</li>
    <li>Serve with crispy fries and your favorite sides</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Variations</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Bacon Burger:</strong> Add 2-3 strips of crispy bacon</li>
    <li><strong>Mushroom Swiss:</strong> Top with sautéed mushrooms and Swiss cheese</li>
    <li><strong>BBQ Burger:</strong> Add BBQ sauce and onion rings</li>
    <li><strong>Spicy Burger:</strong> Add jalapeños and pepper jack cheese</li>
  </ul>
